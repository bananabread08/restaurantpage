## Features & Functionality

- Implemented a Navigation Bar with tabs (Home, About, etc.)
- Navigate through the "pages" of the app via the tabs.

## Objectives and Outcomes

- Project is mainly to practice, to apply, and to learn more about Webpack and OOP.

## Development

Made with VanillaJS with Webpack as bundler. Got to review some more OOP principles. The "pages" are dynamically made to strengthen our understanding with DOM Manipulation.

Built With:

- HTML + CSS
- JavaScript
- Webpack
- eslint/prettier

2. `npm install` on Project Directory.
